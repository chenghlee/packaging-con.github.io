<h1 id="packaging-con-2021-call-for-presentations">Packaging Con 2021: Call for Presentations</h1>

<p>Software complexity is on the rise, but thanks to package managers, reusing software is
easier than it’s ever been. In 2021, nearly every operating system, language ecosystem,
and framework has a package manager or several. Package managers take over where your
compiler left off; integrating different versions of packages and ensuring they can be
installed safely, reliably, and in a compatible configuration on your system. Where
compilers integrate large applications, package managers integrate software ecosystems.</p>

<p>Despite their success, package managers are something of a black art. Working on a
package manager requires a broad range of expertise–from language runtimes, to OS
deployment policy, distribution management, dependency solving and developer workflows,
package managers bridge the gap between developers and last mile software deployment.</p>

<p>We want to understand what brings package management communities together and what sets
them apart. What makes communities work together on a particular software ecosystem? Are
the differences mainly in the implementation language, or are there other key
distinctions to software management methodology? How can we get better interoperability
and/or cooperation among package manager teams, and what’s missing/required to enable
that? Is dependency solving fundamentally the same problem across systems, or does each
package manager do it differently?</p>

<p>If any of these questions interest you, we want to hear from you! Packaging Con is a a
conference for developers of software package management software, as well as software
packagers and communities! Anyone is welcome to participate. Our mission is to bring
different software ecosystems together: from Python’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pip</code> to Rust’s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cargo</code>, from
Debian <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">apt</code> over to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Nix</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">conda</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mamba</code>, and from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">vcpkg</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">spack</code>, and even
to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">npm</code>, we hope to have many different approaches to package management at the
conference.</p>
