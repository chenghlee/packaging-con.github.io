# Packaging Con 2021: Call for Presentations

Software complexity is on the rise, but thanks to package managers, reusing software is
easier than it's ever been. In 2021, nearly every operating system, language ecosystem,
and framework has a package manager or several. Package managers take over where your
compiler left off; integrating different versions of packages and ensuring they can be
installed safely, reliably, and in a compatible configuration on your system. Where
compilers integrate large applications, package managers integrate software ecosystems.

Despite their success, package managers are something of a black art. Working on a
package manager requires a broad range of expertise--from language runtimes, to OS
deployment policy, distribution management, dependency solving and developer workflows,
package managers bridge the gap between developers and last mile software deployment.

We want to understand what brings package management communities together and what sets
them apart. What makes communities work together on a particular software ecosystem? Are
the differences mainly in the implementation language, or are there other key
distinctions to software management methodology? How can we get better interoperability
and/or cooperation among package manager teams, and what's missing/required to enable
that? Is dependency solving fundamentally the same problem across systems, or does each
package manager do it differently?

If any of these questions interest you, we want to hear from you! Packaging Con is a a
conference for developers of software package management software, as well as software
packagers and communities! Anyone is welcome to participate. Our mission is to bring
different software ecosystems together: from Python’s `pip` to Rust’s `cargo`, from
Debian `apt` over to `Nix` to `conda` and `mamba`, and from `vcpkg` to `spack`, and even
to `npm`, we hope to have many different approaches to package management at the
conference.

* Modeling compatibility (semver, API/ABI analysis, etc.)
* Versioning
* Software release methodology: rolling / LTS / others
* Monorepos and package management
* Reproducibility in package managers
* Functional package management, how it relates to other systems
* Reliability/robustness of software ecosystems
