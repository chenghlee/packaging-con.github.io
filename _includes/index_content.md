# PackagingCon 2021

We're working hard on the organization of the first "packaging-con". A conference for developers of software package management software, as well as software packagers and communities! Packaging Con is going to be a two-day virtual event with contributors from all over the planet. Our mission is to bring different eco-systems together: from Python's pip to Rust's cargo, from Debian apt over Nix to conda and mamba, and from vcpkg to Spack we hope to have many different approaches to package management at the conference.

### When and where?

The conference will take place in late 2021. It will be a virtual event for 2021 and (if possible) an in-person event in 2022.
