PackagingCon will return from the 26th to 28th of October, 2023 in Berlin, Germany!

We are currently in the planning stages for PackagingCon 2023.
PackagingCon is a conference for developers of software package management software, as well as software packagers and communities.
PackagingCon 2023 is intended to be a hybrid event with in-person and virtual participation options.

Our mission is to bring different eco-systems together: from Python’s pip to Rust’s cargo to Julia's Pkg, from Debian apt over Nix to conda and mamba, and from vcpkg to Spack we hope to have many different approaches to package management at the conference.
